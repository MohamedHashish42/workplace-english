# **6. Talking About the Workplace**

Offices have different areas for work, meetings, and relaxation. Here are some common places you’ll find in a modern workplace:


## 🏢 Common Places in an Office

### Entry & Movement

- **Reception** → The area at the entrance where visitors are welcomed.  
  *Example:* *Please wait at the reception until your manager arrives.*

- **Parking lot / Car park** → A place where employees park their cars.  
  *Example:* *There is a parking lot next to the office building.*

- **Elevator / Lift** → A machine to move between floors.  
  *Example:* *I take the elevator to the 10th floor every morning.*

- **Corridor / Hallway** → The passage that connects offices or rooms.  
  *Example:* *The meeting rooms are at the end of the corridor.*

### Work & Meetings

- **Open-plan office** → A large office space with many desks and few walls.  
  *Example:* *I work in an open-plan office with my whole team.*

- **Meeting room** → A room used for team discussions or presentations.  
  *Example:* *We have our weekly team meeting in the meeting room.*

- **Phone booth** → A small space for private phone or video calls.  
  *Example:* *I take client calls in the phone booth to avoid noise.*

### Relaxation & Meals

- **Break area** → A place where employees can relax, eat, or drink coffee.  
  *Example:* *We often chat with colleagues in the break area.*

- **Cafeteria / Canteen** → A place where employees eat meals.  
  *Example:* *We usually have lunch in the company cafeteria.*


## 🔄 Workplace Layouts Can Vary

Not all companies have the same office setup. For example:

- Some may not have a cafeteria or phone booths.  
- Remote workers may use virtual meeting rooms instead.  
- Small offices might combine break areas with workspaces.

Focus on the function of each space, not just the name.
